## Sinopia (Docker Image)

> [Sinopia](https://github.com/rlidwka/sinopia) is a private npm repository server.

-----------

> `docker pull rnbwd/sinopia`

- The current latest (this will change soon) is  based on my slighly modified version for use with `jwilder/nginx-proxy` (default build for the last 2 years) `rnbwd/sinopia:proxy` (`latest`).

- For those who want to use the orignal, [unmodified repo](https://github.com/rlidwka/sinopia) and [node v0.10](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v0.10.x/api/), use `rnbwd/sinopia:stable`.

- Also there's an alpine version that's very tiny and efficient, currently experimental `rnbwd/sinopia:alpine`.

- The file structure has been modified - the sinopia repo is located at /sinopia/registry.  See [this issue](https://github.com/rlidwka/sinopia/issues/376) for speculation on the future of sinopia.



### Recommend Usage

- To run default container on port 4873

`docker run --name sinopia -d -p 4873:4873 rnbwd/sinopia`

`docker run --name sinopia -d -p 4873:4873 -v <local-path-to-storage>:/sinopia/registry/storage -v <local-path-to-config>:/sinopia/registry/config.yaml rnbwd/sinopia`

- The volume will be synced, so you can update the anything linked outside of the container and it will automatically change the files inside the container. Run `docker restart sinopia` if `config.yaml` is updated.
